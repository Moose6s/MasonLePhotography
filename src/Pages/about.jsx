        <p className='mb-5'>Hi! I am Mason and I am from the Bay Area. I grew up playing various sports: soccer, baseball, basketball, flag football, laccrosse. I now mostly play volleyball. Throughout school I have always preferred STEM related classes, such as math. As a result I am now studying Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). <br></br><br></br> But I have also enjoyed exploring other fields, specifically in the arts. My mom is an art teacher, despite this I never felt a huge influence from her. What started my photography career was my passion for video games. In 8th grade, right before covid, I created my own YouTube channel. I would post videos of me playing video games, mostly Minecraft. One video of mine, "Trying to Die in Fundy's Baby Mode" - now privated, took off, garnering 2.3 Million views. I managed to amass a following of 50k subscribers. <br></br><br></br> Eventually I got bored and decided to move on. Having an abundance of free time, from the lack of school and no longer making YouTube videos, I decided to experiment with photography. My mom had an old Nikon that I took. This led to a life long passion. <br></br><br></br>
        As I progressed through high school I slowly built a collection of photos. But then I joined my schools film program. This took me down a whole new road. There I created short films, music videos, and short documentaries. It was a way of getting back to my roots of creating videos. <br></br><br></br> I know attend UCSB where I study Computer Science. Here my life consists of 4 main things: studying, surfing, volleyball, and enjoying life. I am hoping to pursue business related work, either through learning from others or experimenting with my own endevours.</p>
